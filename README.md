# Terrorism in Western Europe (2011-2018)

## Introduction 

This is an individual data mining project project that compares jihadist terrorist attacks and non-jihadist terrorist attacks perpetrated in Western Europe between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2018. The analysis compares four main factors: the countries where the attacks took place, the modus operandi of the terrorists, their targets and number of fatalities. As of October 2019, the database includes information on over 190,000 terrorist events occurred around the world from 1970 to 2018. Information on terrorist attacks includes the name of the perpetrator (if known), the modus operandi, the year, and the target(s) hit in the attack. 

## Project Description 

I performed this analysis for my Introduction to Data Mining class at The George Washington Univeristy. The requirement for the project was to perform data mining analysis on a complex dataset to find patterns and associations in order to draw meaningful conclusions and make predictions over time. After cleaning the data, I conducted exploratory data analysis and created informative graphs and plot to identify and present differences and similarities of the attacks carried on by Jihadist and non-Jihadist terrorist groups. 

## Data Source

The data this project is based on was retrieved from the Global Terrorism Database, an open-source database maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland, College Park MD, United States (https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/). START is a research center that studies the causes and consequences of terrorism around the world. The center is a U.S. Department of Homeland Security Emeritus Center of Excellence.
